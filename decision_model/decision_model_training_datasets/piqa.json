Wearing gloves, take each fixture and put some extra ketchup on them and scrub them using an old tooth brush. The ketchup helps make a paste to scrub the extra rust off.        After scrubbing each fixture, place them back in the vinegar solution and let them rest a few more hours.        Scrub more if necessary.        Remove from vinegar solution, rinse off with water, and immediately dry with a cloth or paper towel afterwards. If you don't dry them they will oxidize again with the water and create more rust."

    "correct_answer": "Ich is the most common fish illness in the aquarium hobby. Luckily, with few exceptions, it is also one of the easiest to treat. In the past, it was treated by increasing the temperature of the tank to to above 85 degrees and adding aquarium salt. This method is not always effective, and heat resistant strains of the parasite have been identified. The best method to treat Ich is a two pronged attack. First, feed fish food treated with Metronidazole. This will kill the parasite while it is attached to the fishes body and gills. Secondly, treat the tank water with Seachem's Paraguard. Unlike many other medications, Paraguard is safe for use on scaleless fish and invertebrates. Metro should be used with caution with ornamental snails."

Use the knife to cut parallel to the chopping board from the top down to the root, from the side furthest from the board to just above it. Do this many times for a fine dice, or just a couple for large sections. Turn the knife around so the sharp blade points down at the board and the point points toward the root, and do the same thing again from left to right. Finally, turn the knife so the blade points down at the board and the point points parallel to the root, and cut slices from the farthest part of the onion away from the root, to close up to the root. Remove the root, and chop the onions with the knife in a rocking motion if need be, holding the blade rightly just above the handle between thumb and forefinger."

    "correct_answer": "To make basic meatballs, you\u2019ll need 1/2 cup milk, 1/2 cup fine breadcrumbs, 1 large egg, 1 teaspoon salt, freshly ground black pepper, 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese, 1/4 cup finely minced Italian parsley, 1 pound ground meat (such as beef, pork, turkey, chicken, or veal, or a mix), 1/2 cup finely chopped onion (or grated on a coarse grater) from 1 small yellow onion, and 1 clove garlic      Combine the milk and breadcrumbs. Place the breadcrumbs in a small bowl, pour in the milk, and stir to combine. Set aside while preparing the rest of the meatball mixture. The breadcrumbs will absorb the milk and become soggy.    Whisk the egg, salt, pepper, Parmesan, and parsley. Whisk the egg in a large bowl until broken up. Add the Parmesan, parsley, salt, and a generous quantity of black pepper, and whisk to combine.    Add the ground meat. Add the meat to the egg mixture. Use your hands to thoroughly mix the egg mixture into the ground meat.    Add the onions and soaked breadcrumbs. Add the onions, garlic, and soaked breadcrumbs. Mix them thoroughly into the meat with your fingers. Try not to overwork the meat; pinch the meat between your fingers rather than kneading it.    Form the meat into meatballs. Have a rimmed baking sheet ready. Pinch off a piece of the meat mixture and gently roll between your hands to form 1 1/2-inch meatballs (about 2 tablespoons each). Continue shaping until all the meat is used, placing the meatballs on the baking sheet so that they are not touching.    Option 1: Roast or broil the meatballs in the oven. Broil the meatballs 20 to 25 minutes, or roast at 400\u00b0F for 25 to 30 minutes. (Watch closely if making meatballs made with lean meat.) The meatballs are done when cooked through, the outsides are browned, and they register 165\u00b0F in the middle on an instant-read thermometer. Serve immediately.    Option 2: Cook the meatballs directly in sauce. Bring a marinara or other pasta sauce to a simmer and add as many meatballs as will fit comfortably in the pan. Cover and simmer for 30 to 35 minutes. The meatballs are done when they're cooked through and register 165\u00b0F in the middle on an instant-read thermometer. Serve immediately."

    "correct_answer": "Use a shovel or pick to dig into the ground several inches away from the bulb clump and work your way around, taking care you don\u2019t accidentally cut into the bulbs. Lift the clump and gently shake off excess soil to reveal the bulbs.    Divide daffodil bulbs by twisting and pulling them off the clump. It usually takes a slight tug to separate the roots from the clump. Dispose of all damaged, mushy, infected looking bulbs.    If you wish to replant right away, sow them at the new site at the original depth, making sure the leafy growth is above, the bulb and white stem are under the soil line. Water well after replanting.    If you intend to replant daffodils in fall, you\u2019ll need to store them properly so they can survive the stretch. Lay them all out indoors on clean, dry newspapers and leave them be for 7-10 days.    Remove the leaves when they\u2019re crisp and brown and gently brush off any dirt that\u2019s still sticking to the bulbs. Go easy, there\u2019s no need to wash the bulbs or to get them absolutely spot free.    Place the bulbs in nylon or mesh bags (cleaned onion sacks will do just fine too), label them and then store them in a cool, dry but ventilated location.    Come fall, take out bulbs and inspect them. A soft bulb is a dead bulb and should be safely disposed of. Plant the good ones in suitable locations, about 4-6\u201d deep and water thoroughly immediately afterwards"

It is very important the order. Only after the negative clamp is removed, remove the positive clamp, marked with a \"+\". Combine 2\u20133 tablespoons of baking soda with a tablespoons or so of water. Stir to make a paste. Apply the baking soda paste to the battery connections. Be careful, although baking soda is generally safe, you should take care not to get it on other car components or on your self. Once the baking soda is applied, you will see it bubble and foam, as it reacts with the corrosion. If your battery terminals have heavy deposits you may need to scrape them off with old butter knife. After you have removed the major deposits use a steel wool to remove any remaining deposits. Rinse the connection using a little water. Be careful not to rinse the the baking soda paste into the battery vents, as the baking soda can neutralize the battery's acid and shorten the battery's life. Wipe the terminals clean with a dry clean rag. Add something hydrophobic, such as petroleum jelly (vaseline) or grease to the now cleaned terminals. This will help slow future corrosion. Put on the positive clamp first, then the negative clamp. Use a wrench to tighten if needed. Once the clamps are on, replace the rubber or plastic shields covering the clamp/terminal junction."

Empty your iron of any water that might be left inside and turn it on to the lowest possible setting. Place a clean cloth over the stain. Apply the iron to the area of the cloth covering the stain for a very brief moment. Use a piece of 120-grit sandpaper to gently sand your wooden counter-tops. Remember to sand with the grain. After giving it a good once over with the 120-grit paper, switch to a piece of 180-grit sandpaper and sand the counter-tops, again keeping with the natural grain of the wood. Once you finish sanding,  apply food-safe mineral oil and rub it into the wood grain with a clean rag. Let it soak into the wood for about 30 minutes, and then wipe away any excess mineral oil residue with a paper towel."

Set aside.        In a medium bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.        In a large bowl, using a hand or stand mixer, cream the peanut butter, butter and sugars together.         Once the peanut butter and sugar mixture is light and fluffy, add the egg and vanilla extract.         After the egg and vanilla are fully incorporated, add the dry ingredients. Whisk just until the flour mixture is combined and a thick dough is formed (If chilling the dough, do so at this point for a minimum of 30 minutes).         Scoop the dough into heaped tablespoon sized balls. Roll each ball in sugar then place on your prepared cookie sheets about 2 inches apart.         Using a fork,  flatten the cookies and press down creating an x shape and that classic cross-hatch pattern across the top of each cookie.         Bake the cookies for 14-16 minutes until golden brown and fragrant.             Transfer the cookies to a cooling rack and allow to cool and enjoy!        Once the cookies are fully cooled they can be covered and stored in an airtight container at room temperature for 3-4 days."
